# Ontology Concepts
## E7_Activity
Scope note:
This class comprises actions intentionally carried out by instances of E39 Actor that result in changes of state in the cultural, social, or physical systems documented. 
This notion includes complex, composite, and long-lasting actions such as the building of a settlement or a war, as well as simple, short-lived actions such as the opening of a door.

Examples:
- the Battle of Stalingrad (Hoyt, 1993)
- the Yalta Conference (Harbutt, 2010)
- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995
- the writing of “Faust” by Goethe (E65) (Williams, 2020)
- the formation of the Bauhaus 1919 (E66) (Droste, 2006)
- the people of Iraq giving the name ‘Quyunjig’ to the place identified by the TGN as ‘7017998’
- Kira Weber working in glass art from 1984 to 1993
- Kira Weber working in oil and pastel painting from 1993

In First Order Logic:
- E7(x) ⇒ E5(x)

## E8_Acquisition
Scope note:
This class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more other instances of E39 Actor. 
The class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of rights. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1. the beginning of ownership
2. the end of ownership
3. the transfer of ownership
4. the acquisition from an unknown source
5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item
It may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example, by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of “accession” differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.

Examples:
- the collection of a hammerhead shark, genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes), by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on 25(th) March 1940. (Steinbeck, 2000)
- the acquisition of El Greco’s “The Apostles Peter and Paul” by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. (https://hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/32730)
- the loss of my stuffed Fringilla coelebs due to insect damage last year (fictitious)

In First Order Logic:
- E8(x) ⇒ E7(x)

## E12_Production
Scope note:
This class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items. 
It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. 
This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. 
An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.

Examples:
- the construction of the SS Great Britain (Gregor, 1971)
- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen (Dewey, 2003)
- Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12, E65, E81) (Hind, 1923)

In First Order Logic:
- E12(x) ⇒ E11(x)
- E12(x) ⇒ E63(x)

## E19_Physical_Object
Scope note:
This class comprises items of a material nature that are units for documentation and have physical boundaries that separate them completely in an objective way from other objects. 
The class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessmen. Typically, instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).
In some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called “bona fide objects”, i.e. naturally defined objects (Smith & Varzi, 2000). 
The decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be purely administrative or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.

Examples:
- Aphrodite of Milos (E22) (Kousser, 2005)
- the Cullinan Diamond (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)
- Apollo 13 at the time of launch (E22) (Lovell and Kluger, 1994)

In First Order Logic:
- E19(x) ⇒ E18(x)

## E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing
Scope note:
This class comprises all persistent physical items of any size that are purposely created by human activity. This class comprises, besides others, human-made objects, such as a sword, and human-made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.
Instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even human-made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.
Whereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it human-made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may continue to be non-human-made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.

Examples:
- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).
- the Channel Tunnel (E25) (Holliday, Marcou and Vickerman, 1991)
- the Palace of Knossos (Evans, 1921)
- the Colosseum in Rome, Italy (Hopkins and Beard, 2011)
- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78) (Georgoula, 2005)
- the Rosetta Stone (E22)
- my paperback copy of Crime & Punishment (E22) (fictitious)
- the computer disk at ICS-FORTH that stores the canonical Definition of the CIDOC CRM v.3.2 (E22)
- my empty DVD disk (E22) (fictitious)

In First Order Logic:
- E24(x) ⇒ E18(x)
- E24(x) ⇒ E71(x)

## E39_Actor
Scope note:
This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which they can be held responsible.

Examples:
- London and Continental Railways (E74)
- the Governor of the Bank of England in 1975 (E21)
- Sir Ian McKellen (E21) (Gibson, 1986)

In First Order Logic:
- E39(x) ⇒ E77(x)

## E41_Appellation
Scope note:
This class comprises all signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class within a certain context.
Instances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e. other instances of E41 Appellation that are regarded as equivalent, regardless of the thing it denotes.
Different languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.
Instances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses of E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance “dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.
Even numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.
E41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment.

Examples:
- “Martin”
- “Aquae Sulis Minerva”
- “the Merchant of Venice” (E35) (McCullough, 2005)
- “Spigelia marilandica (L.) L.” [not the species, just the name] (Hershberger, Robacker and Jenkins, 2015)
- “information science” [not the science itself, but the name used to refer to the subject matter in an English-speaking context]
- “安” [Chinese “an”, meaning “peace”]
- “6°5’29”N 45°12’13”W” [example of a spatial coordinate]
- “Black queen’s bishop 4” [chess coordinate, example of an identifier in a conceptual space (E89)]
- “19-MAR-1922” [example of date]
- “+41 22 418 5571” [example of contact point]
- “weasel@paveprime.com” [example of contact point]
- “CH-1211, Genève” [example of place appellation]
- “1-29-3 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 121, Japan” [example of a postal address]
- “the poop deck of H.M.S Victory” [example of a section definition on a human-made object (E22)]
- “the Venus de Milo’s left buttock” [example of a section definition on a human-made object (E22)]

In First Order Logic:
- E41(x) ⇒ E90(x)

## E52_Time-Span
Scope note:
This class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end, and a duration. 
Instances of E52 Time-Span have no semantic connotations about phenomena happening within the temporal extent they represent. They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.
Some instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.
Some instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span. 
When used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.

Examples:
- 1961
- From 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996
- 14h30 to 16h22 4(th) July 1945
- 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999
- the time-span of the Ming Dynasty (Chan, 2011)

In First Order Logic:
- E52(x) ⇒ E1(x)

## E53_Place
Scope note:
This class comprises extents in the natural space where people live, in particular on the surface of the Earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.
The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).

Examples:
- the extent of the UK in the year 2003
- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring (fictitious)
- the place referred to in the phrase: “Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone”
- here -> <- [the place between these two arrows in one of the reader's paper copy of this document. Each copy constitutes a different place of this spot.]

In First Order Logic:
- E53(x) ⇒ E1(x)

## E54_Dimension
Scope note:
This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values, etc.
An instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.
The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.
Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.

Examples:
- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]
- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]
- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]
- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]
- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)
- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)
- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E. [less than 12 hours] (Howard, 2012)
- Christie’s hammer price, in British Pounds, for Vincent van Gogh's "Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers" in London on 30(th) March 1987 (E97) [24.75 million GBP (British Pounds)]

In First Order Logic:
- E54(x) ⇒ E1(x)

## E55_Type
Scope note:
This class comprises concepts denoted by terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to characterize and classify instances of CIDOC CRM classes. Instances of E55 Type represent concepts, in contrast to instances of E41 Appellation which are used to name instances of CIDOC CRM classes. 
E55 Type provides an interface to domain specific ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CIDOC CRM as subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of E55 Type linked via P127 has broader term (has narrower term): E55 Type. Such hierarchies may be extended with additional properties.

Examples:
- weight, length, depth [types for instances of E54 Dimension]
- portrait, sketch, animation [types for instances of E36 Visual Item]
- French, English, German [types for instances of E56 Language]
- excellent, good, poor [types for instances of E3 Condition State]
- Ford Model T, chop stick [types for instances of E22 Human-Made Object]
- cave, doline, scratch [types for instances of E26 Physical Feature]
- poem, short story [types for instances of E33 Linguistic Object]
- wedding, earthquake, skirmish [types for instances of E5 Event]

In First Order Logic:
- E55(x) ⇒ E28(x)

## E57_Material
Scope note:
This class is a specialization of E55 Type and comprises the concepts of materials. 
Instances of E57 Material may denote properties of matter before its use, during its use, and as incorporated in an object, such as ultramarine powder, tempera paste, reinforced concrete. Discrete pieces of raw-materials kept in museums, such as bricks, sheets of fabric, pieces of metal, should be modelled individually in the same way as other objects. Discrete used or processed pieces, such as the stones from Nefer Titi's temple, should be modelled as parts (cf. P46 is composed of (forms part of): E18 Physical Thing).
This type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model does not foresee the description of instances of instances of E57 Material, e.g. “instances of gold”.
It is recommended that internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminology should be used.

Examples:
- brick (Gurcke, 1987)
- gold (Watson, 1990)
- aluminium (Norman, 1986)
- polycarbonate (Mhaske, 2011)
- resin (Barton, 1992)

In First Order Logic:
- E57(x) ⇒ E55(x)

## E65_Creation
Scope note:
This class comprises events that result in the creation of conceptual items or immaterial products, such as legends, poems, texts, music, images, movies, laws, types, etc.

Examples:
- the framing of the U.S. Constitution (Farrand, 1913)
- the drafting of U.N. Resolution 1441 (United Nations Security Council, 2002)

In First Order Logic:
- E65(x) ⇒ E7(x)
- E65(x) ⇒ E63(x)

## E73_Information_Object
Scope note:
This class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as poems, jokes, data sets, images, texts, multimedia objects, procedural prescriptions, computer program code, algorithm or mathematical formulae, that have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. The encoding structure known as a “named graph” also falls under this class, so that each “named graph” is an instance of E73 Information Object.
An instance of E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
Instances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a reproducible expression.

Examples:
- image BM000038850.JPG from the Clayton Herbarium in London (E31) (Natural History Museum, 2021)
- E. A. Poe's “The Raven” (Poe, 1869)
- the movie “The Seven Samurai” by Akira Kurosawa (Mellen, 2002)
- the text of Huray describing the Maxwell Equations (Huray, 2010)
- the Getty AAT as published as Linked Open Data, accessed 1/10/2014

In First Order Logic:
- E73(x) ⇒ E89(x)
- E73(x) ⇒ E90(x)
